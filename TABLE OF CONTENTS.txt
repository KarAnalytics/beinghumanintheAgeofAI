1. THE ECONOMICS OF SEARCH:
    IDEA OF CHAPTER IS TO CAPTURE THE ECONOMICS OF TRADITIONAL SEARCH LIKE GOOGLE VS. LLM BASED SEARCH, CAPTURING COST, COMPLEXITY AND TIME. MAYBE LOOK AT REASON FOR SEARCH AND QUANTIFY.


2. OMNIPRESENT AI
    UNLIKE TRADITIONAL INTERNET, INFORMATION IS PRESENT IN FORM OF AI IN HANDS. WHAT DROVE THIS? ADVANTAGES? WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS?


3. PREDICTION UNROLLED
    EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENS IN A DIALOGUE OR CONVERSATION WITH AI, SEQUENCE OF TOKEN PREDICTIONS? HOW DOES IT RELATE TO CONTEXT/MEMORY


4. TRAINING VS PRE-TRAINING
    NEED FOR FRESH TRAINING OF ML MODELS VS PACKAGED VERSION OF PRE-TRAINED MODELS


5. ECONOMICS OF DATA
    DATA ACQUISITION IS COSTLY WHICH MEANS TRAINING NEW MODELS ARE COSTLIER. BETTER LEAVE THIS TO GIANTS LIKE OPENAI, CLAUDE WHO ARE BETTER AT REDUCING THE UNIT TRAINING COST.


6. THE GIANT SLAYER (WHO'S GONNA WIN)
    WHOSE GONNA WIN THE RACE TO DEVELOP NEW, BETTER MODELS


7. ERROR-BOUND
    HOW DOES HUMAN BIAS PERMEATE AI MODELS


8. COGNITIVE DIVISION OF LABOR
     DISCUSS HOW THE COGNITIVE DIVISION OF LABOR WORKS, HOW IT APPLIES TO AI


9. ANALYSIS PARALYSIS
      DIFFICULTY OF EVALUATING THE AI MODELS. WHATS THE SOLUTION

10. AUTONOMY VS. AGENCY
      AUTONOMY (INDEPENDENCE FROM EXTERNAL CONTROL), AGENCY (THINK, PLAN GOALS, ACT, COORDINATE, FEEDBACK)

11. HUMAN IN THE LOOP
       RLHF MECHANISM AND HOW THIS IS USEFUL. PROBLEMS WITH RLHF. RLHF TO IMPROVE LANGUAGE MODEL REASONING, CHAIN OF ACTION THOUGHT (COAT) APPROACH - CONTINUE, REFLECT, EXPLORE (MAOHAO SHEN MIT)
